(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (optimize_0plus_b)  *)
(** Since the [optimize_0plus] tranformation doesn't change the value
    of [aexp]s, we should be able to apply it to all the [aexp]s that
    appear in a [bexp] without changing the [bexp]'s value.  Write a
    function which performs that transformation on [bexp]s, and prove
    it is sound.  Use the tacticals we've just seen to make the proof
    as elegant as possible. *)

Theorem optimize_0plus_sound: forall a,
  aeval (optimize_0plus a) = aeval a.
Proof.
  intros a. induction a.
  Case "ANum". reflexivity.

      SSCase "n = 0".  simpl. apply IHa2.
      SSCase "n <> 0". simpl. rewrite IHa2. reflexivity.
    SCase "a1 = APlus a1_1 a1_2".
      simpl. simpl in IHa1. rewrite IHa1.
